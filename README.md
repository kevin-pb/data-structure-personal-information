## Tipes of data structure

In this project we want to represent information in different data structures. The information we want to represent is the name, age, sex, status and addresses corresponding to people and the data structures in which I want to represent this information are:

1- CVS(Coma Separed Value)

2- JSON(JavaScript Object Notation,)

3- YAML( Ain't Markup Language)

4- TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language)

5- XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

6- INI (windows INItialization file)

### Problems:
CSV (Comma Separated Value), as the name implies, is a data structure where values ​​are separated by commas. CSV is readable by programs like Excel, with commas defining the columns. When I wanted to represent the information in CSV, I ran into a problem. This was that one of the data, to be more specific, the addresses could not be represented in a common way. I came up with two possible solutions; one was to duplicate the information so that the addresses matched their respective persons and the other was to create a separate file where the addresses could be placed. From there, a solution could be found. Of those two options, you can use the one you prefer. On the other hand, the rest of the data structures did not cause any problems.

Once this is clear, you can proceed to download the files and use the data structure that you prefer.
